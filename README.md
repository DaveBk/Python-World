# Python-World
(OOP) my learning exercises

I intend to expand my knowledge as Python dev.
This repo contains a simulation of the world.

## A world in which the following rules:
The world is flat and has height and width.
Every organism in the world has:
* power: increases every turn by 1; determines the strength of the body
* initiative: priority determines the order in which a move is made in one turn
* position: world position
* liveLength: the number of turns for the rest of your life
* powerToReproduce: lower limit of force above which it can reproduce; after multiplication, it loses half its strength
* sign: a sign representing the body in the world
* world: the world in which the body lives
